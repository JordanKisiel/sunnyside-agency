## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

Initially I started this project using the CUBE CSS methodology but found it to be cumbersome when I came time to add responsiveness. Even though I was skeptical, I had seen a lot of good feedback from others who had used Tailwind for CSS so I decided to give it a try. It was a little slow at first because I had to learn the naming conventions that Tailwind uses but it wasn't long before I found myself working just as fast if not faster than working with vanilla CSS.

I also learned how to work with build tools and more specifically with NPM, Vite, and package.json files.

### Continued development

I definitely want to continue using Tailwind in future project and see how much faster I can get as my familiarity with framework increases.

I would also like to find a project that requires me to write more JavaScript.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind Crash Course | Project From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFgzHOX84xQ) - I found this tutorial to be a great introduction to getting started with Tailwind.
